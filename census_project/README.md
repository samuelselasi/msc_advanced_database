# Population And Housing Census Database Management
> The Statistical department contracted you to develop a `Census Database Management System` for its operations. 
You have been provided with the current manual form as attached.

## Requirements:
1. Carefully analyse the requirements, and identify the `entity`, `attributes`, `constraints`, etc
2. Draw an **E/R** model of the system, showing `one-to-one` and `one-to-many`.
   Normalize relations that have `many-to-many` relationships.
3. Create a database in Oracle or any relational database.
   Create all the tables above, taking into consideration the referential keys.
   Specify appropriate data types, field lengths, and other constraints you consider necessary.
4. Design a user interface in any object-oriented programming language (Java, PHP, ASP.NET, C++, PHP, etc). 
   Your interface should be ***linked*** to one or more tables through an `API` (connection string) to access the database.
5. On the user interface, provide the ff. buttons; 
    - **insert** record, 
    - **retrieve** record, 
    - **update** record, 
    - **delete** record from the database table(s), and 
    - **Backup**.
6. Write a program in your chosen object-oriented programming language to perform the appropriate tasks when the user clicks on the buttons in `5` above.
   Use the frontend script to do the following:
   - **insert** record 
   - **retrieve** record 
   - **update** record 
   - **delete** record 
7. Write a program in your chosen object-oriented programming language to perform the appropriate tasks when the user clicks on the buttons in `6` above.
   Use the ff. database backend to do the following:
   - **insert** record – *using stored procedures*
   - **retrieve** record – *using cursors*
   - **update** record – *using stored procedures*
   - **delete** record – *using stored procedures*
8.  Use the `join` statements to retrieve records from multiple tables.
9.  Use triggers to log user activities on a specified table into a log table.
10. Use any of the partitioning strategies to partition one of your tables into three, then 
    write a single query to retrieve records from all the partitions.
11. Under the `Backup` button in `5`, write a script to take a backup of your database.
