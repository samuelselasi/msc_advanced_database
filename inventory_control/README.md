![inventoryERD](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d187b993-ff53-42d7-b0e8-08d5d3123b5b)

> A company wishes to create a database to control its inventory,
which consits of a number of products divided into a number of categories,
such as clothing, food, and stationery. An employee raises a purchase order
when a product has to be recorded from the supplier.
The tracking supplies received, units sold, and any wastage.
